# 3D Product Cards

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/mijhasila/pen/yLorPmQ](https://codepen.io/mijhasila/pen/yLorPmQ).

A project I used to learn a little bit more about using 3D CSS properties and some practice with more performant animated shadow effects.

The little things that make me happy:
- More performant box-shadow transitions. Box shadow is applied to :after and only the opacity is being animated. Learned this trick from @tobiasahlin  http://tobiasahlin.com/blog/how-to-animate-box-shadow/
- Button transitions on back of card.
